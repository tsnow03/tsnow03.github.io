	<b> ASTR-1000 (The Solar System)</b><p>
	  I had the amazing opportunity to teach this course as instructor of record at CU Boulder. I strongly believe in using this type of entry-level astronomy course as a tool to develop scientific thinking in students, so I developed the course to encourage this result. I wrote the syllabus, planned the lectures, instituted a backward learning approach, included a 'Science in the News' investigative element, and used inquiry-based learning tools such as clickers and classroom discussion. <a href="files/syllabus.pdf"> Here</a> is my full syllabus.

	<b>Professional Development Program</b><p>
	  I participated in the PDP in 2017; this is a full year commitment that provides multiple immersive workshops on teaching technique and pedagogy. At the end of the PDP, I developed and taught a two-day inquiry-based exoplanet workshop for summer student at CU. We also included several equity discussions throughout the two days, exploring topics such as 'what does it mean to be a scientist?'. We believe that this type of discussion is extremely important for first-generation college students, many of whom are unsure of their major.
