<p><b>Using sea surface temperatures to study subsurface water temperatures near Helheim Glacier in southeast Greenland</b>                                                                                                                                           
<p>The warm water melting glaciers around Greenland sits below 150 m depth, making them challenging to study using satellites. I worked with Fiamma Straneo and Jamie Holte from Scripps Institute of Oceanography to find a new way of using satellite-derived sea surface temperatures (SST) to determine surface and subsurface water temperatures near Helheim Glacier (one of the largest glaciers in Greenland found on the southeastern coast). To create this proxy, we used knowledge of ocean circulation patterns in the area and paired ocean temperatures measured from a mooring near Helheim Glacier with sea surface temperatures measured by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Aqua and Terra satellites to determine their relationship. In situ measurements only go back to 2010, but the MODIS SST records span back to 2000 allowing us to ascertain ocean information back to that time period if a proxy relationship is developed.

<p> We found that once MODIS SSTs were adjusted for atmospheric temperatures (air-sea heat exchange), they could be used as a measure of surface ocean temperatures. In regions where surface waters are fully mixed down to deeper layers, the adjusted SSTs proved a proxy for subsurface waters as well. In a mixing region over Sermilik Trough near Helheim Glacier, the water column is homogneous (adjusted SSTs can be used as a proxy for subsurface water temperatures) and they reflect the water heading toward Helheim Glacier based on our in situ observations. Therefore, we were able to use adjusted MODIS SSTs to reconstruct warm water temperatures heading toward Helheim Glacier for the last 20 years.

<p><b>Using deep learning to identify high redshift merging galaxies in JWST</b>
<p>To identify high redshift merging galaxies, it is crucial to independently establish new multi-band merger classification techniques and to carefully calibrate them for high redshift minor and major mergers. My approach has been to develop <a href="https://github.com/beckynevin/CiNNamonroll">CiNNamonroll</a>, a suite of multi-channel CNNs trained from realistic mock images from the state-of-the-art IllustrisTNG50 simulation to identify high redshift merging galaxies in JWST imaging surveys.
<img src="files/TNG_mocks.png" width=500 class="center"> 
<p>A central goal of mine is to incorporate interpretive methods such as saliency maps and concept activation vectors to gain astrophysical implications from the classifications. In order to apply the CNNs to JWST images, I plan to employ domain adaptive techniques to create catalogs of minor and major mergers. This work will develop methods to directly compare mergers in IllustrisTNG to the real Universe, which will be critical for testing Lambda CDM cosmology. It will also provide key results for determining how major and minor mergers drive the mass and structure assembly of early galaxies.

<p><b> Identifying merging galaxies in SDSS</b>
<p> I am currently applying the imaging classification (below, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01975">Nevin+2019</a>) to the full SDSS photometric dataset (Nevin et al. 2022, in prep). From the catalogs of different types of mergers, I calculate the merger fraction locally as a function of stellar mass, redshift, and morphology. These empirical measurements are important tests of Lambda CDM predictions and the merger samples will enable further investigation of if and how different types and stages of mergers drive galaxy evolution.

  <p><b>Galaxy Mergers: Bridging observations and simulations</b> 
   
<p>



One way to study mergers is through merger simulations that allow me to take detailed notes about how the signatures of mergers change with time. I have been working with Laura Blecha at the University of Florida to create a beautiful simulation suite of merging galaxies using the SUNRISE simulations:

<p>
From these simulations, I create mock observations to match [insert your favorite galaxy survey]. Here, I'm showing a mock SDSS r-band image and mock MaNGA stellar kinematic maps:


<img src="files/website_mock.png" width=500 class="center">
<p>
From these mock images and kinematic maps, I have developed a galaxy merger classification tool that learns to identify various different types of galaxy mergers. The statistical learning classification tool relies upon parametric and non-parametric 'predictors', which I extract from the images and kinematic maps of the merger to assign a given galaxy a probability of being in a merger. This is my paper on the imaging side of the approach: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01975">Nevin+2019</a>, and this is my paper on the stellar kinematic side of the approach: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02208">Nevin+2021</a>

  <p><b>Active Galactic Nuclei: The motions of energetic gas</b> 
<p>
    Supermassive black holes are one of the biggest paradoxes in the universe - not only are they one of the darkest places, but the region around them can shine bright as a quasar &#128516;. Supermassive black holes that are actively accreting gas are known as active galactic nuclei (AGN).
  <p>
 I focus on the kinematics of AGN, including the powerful biconical outflows they can drive from their central regions. These outflows have the potential to impact their host galaxies (SMBHs live in the centers of galaxies), so I focus on modeling their energetics using an analytical MCMC approach. This technique has the advantage of providing a posterior probability of the parameters of the bicone, meaning that I can constrain both the geometry and the energetics of these AGN-driven outflows based on their optical emission lines.

<img src="files/bicones.png" width=500>

<p>
I have measured the energetics of 18 AGN-driven outflows (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00828">Nevin+2018</a>) and I find that these moderate-luminosity AGN drive powerful outflows (below). This is exciting because moderate-luminosity AGN are more common than their more energetic cousins, the quasars, so they have more potential to impact the formation of stars in the universe. I also find that the host galaxies of the AGN-driven outflows tend to be redder with lower star formation rates; additionally, since these outflows have wide opening angles, they intersect the ISM of their host galaxies, which is a way for them to deliver energy to star forming regions.

<p>
I also spend a good amount of time fitting Gaussians to emission lines both to perform emission line diagnostics, such as BPT diagrams and to constrain the kinematic origin of various emission line features. I created a kinematic classification for double-peaked AGN and proved that the majority were associated with outflow-dominated kinematics (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04018">Nevin+2016</a>).

<p><b>Case studies: Focusing on fascinating galaxies and AGN</b>
<p>  
Sometimes I like to work with individual galaxies. These objects are really interesting for a number of reasons; many of them have complicated interconnections between AGN-driven outflows and star formation.

<p> 
'J1354' is interesting because it has an example of an AGN turning on and off, powering an outflow first in the south and then one in the north (<a a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00825">Comerford...Nevin+2017</a>).

<p> NGC6240 has it all (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0033-2">Muller-Sanchez,Nevin+2018</a>). It is a confirmed dual AGN and also hosts a star-formation driven outflow in addition to an AGN-driven outflow. The energy budget of both are required to shut down star formation.

  <p><b>Machine learning: Exciting applications with astrophysical questions</b> 
<p>  
As data gets larger and more sophisticated, it is increasingly important to pay attention to the techniques used to carry out the scientific analysis. It is truly a curse of too much data at times, and some of the aspects of the data often go unused just because the data is unwieldly, or it is initially difficult to visualize. I enjoy thinking about novel ways to get more bang for our buck. I particularly like to harness various machine learning techniques to do science, which often involves developing tools that push machine learning to become more scientific (i.e., with error analysis built in or with in depth discussion of the physical implications of the results).

<p>
One potential application of ML to astronomy is harnessing unsupervised clustering to uncover classes of objects, such as different types of kinematic maps (below).
